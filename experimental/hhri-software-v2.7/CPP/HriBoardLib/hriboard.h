/**
 * @brief Class to interface with a HRI board.
 *
 * After creating an instance of this class, connect your custom slot functions
 * to the signals
 *
 * Then, call openLink() to establish the communication link with the board.
 * If successfull, this object will automatically request the synchronized
 * variables list, and call the given slot function. You can then inspect this
 * link and find useful variables to stream or modify. To operate on these
 * SyncVars, you can either directly interact with the SyncVarBase (generic)
 * pointers of the list, or create typed pointer by doing dynamic_cast or
 * calling getVarHandle().
 *
 * To set the value of a SyncVar on the board, call writeRemoteVar().
 * To get the value of a SyncVar from the board, call readRemoteVar(), and
 * wait until SyncVar::isUpToDate() becomes true.
 * To continuously receive the value of several variables, setup the streaming
 * with setStreamedVars(). The given queue object will then be filled
 * continuously, as the values are received from the board.
